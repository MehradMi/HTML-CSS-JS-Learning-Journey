                <p>Kenshiro walks alone, a guardian of forgotten paths
                   and sacred fields. His presence is quiet, yet commanding
                   — a silhouette against the rising sun. 
                   Legends say he once turned the tide of war with a single glance,
                   but he seeks no fame. His code is honor, his purpose is balance.</p>

                <h2>Tsukikage — “Moon’s Shadow”</h2>
                <p>Forged from celestial steel and cooled in mountain springs, 
                   Tsukikage is more than a weapon —
                   it’s a legacy. Its blade reflects moonlight even in darkness, 
                   and its edge never dulls. Engraved with ancient runes, 
                   it hums softly when danger nears, as if whispering to its master.</p>

                <p>They say he was born beneath the cherry blossoms, 
                   raised by silence and sword. The samurai roams the emerald fields, 
                   where grass sways like waves and the trees stand as sentinels. 
                   No one knows his name, only the trail of justice he leaves behind. 
                   Villagers speak of his arrival as a breeze before a storm — 
                   calm, swift, and unforgettable.</p>

                <h2>Lore</h2>
                <p>Long ago, in a land untouched by time, 
                   a warrior emerged from the shadows of the forest.
                   His name was lost to history, but his deeds carved stories into the bark of ancient trees. 
                   Clad in weathered armor and wielding a blade forged in moonlight, 
                   the samurai wandered the fields — not seeking glory, but balance. 
                   He defended the weak, challenged the corrupt, and vanished like morning fog. 
                   Some say he still walks among the trees, watching, waiting, guarding 
                   the harmony of nature and man.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col col-bg col-1"> 
                <p>In the heart of a misty field,
                   where ancient trees whisper secrets to the wind, 
                   walks a lone samurai. His armor bears the scars of countless battles, 
                   yet his eyes reflect peace. 
                   He is legend — not for the wars he fought, but for the honor he upheld.</p>
